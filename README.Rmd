<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of spex is to provide an online tool for simple exploration of biological 
datasets.

It is currently running [here](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/shiny/spex/spex/) on the Babraham shiny server with an example dataset.  

The initial page currently looks like this:
![](man/figures/README-start_page_screenshot.png)
   
The tabs allow the user to explore a dataset, metadata information and an example plot are shown below.  
![](man/figures/README-metadata_screenshot.png)
   
![](man/figures/README-density_screenshot.png)
   
   
```{r first_page, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
plot(start_page_screenshot)
```


## Installation

This is currently under initial development and has not been released.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
